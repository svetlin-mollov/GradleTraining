When you use the “must run after” ordering rule you specify that taskB must always run after taskA, 
whenever both taskA and taskB will be run. This is expressed as taskB.mustRunAfter(taskA). 
The “should run after” ordering rule is similar but less strict as it will be ignored in two situations. 
Firstly if using that rule introduces an ordering cycle. Secondly when using parallel execution 
and all dependencies of a task have been satisfied apart from the “should run after” task, then 
this task will be run regardless of whether its “should run after” dependencies have been run or not. 
You should use “should run after” where the ordering is helpful but not strictly required.
